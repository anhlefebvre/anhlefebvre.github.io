# Neuroscience student üß†

I am a second-year Master's student in Cognitive and Behavioural Neuroscience at Sorbonne University in France, who have a strong interest in the neural mechanisms of working and long-term episodic memory. I am motivated to understand how memory processes are altered in pathologies, in which memory is affected. My goal is to pursue a PhD programme in order to deepen my understanding of memory deficits and their impact on cognition and behaviour.

## Manuscript
**Internship: Disentangling the Effects of Meaningfulness on Item- and Binding Memory** (In preparation)<br>
<span class="meta">Supervisor: Prof. Klaus Oberauer, Dr. Philipp Musfeld, University of Zurich</span><br>
Investigated how semantic meaning influences visual working memory by replicating prior experiments and applying a Bayesian hierarchical framework. The findings showed that meaningful stimuli enhance both item memory and binding memory, thus supporting the Binding Hypothesis.<br>

## Academic Projects

**Report: Assessment of Two Unknown Compounds in Depression-like and Anxiety Behaviour in Wild-Type SWISS mice** <br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Neuropharmacology</span><br>
Tested two novel compounds for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in a murine model using behavioral paradigms (OFT, EPM, TST). Results suggested potential antidepressant properties for one compound, though further research is needed to confirm efficacy.<br>

**Report: Learning Behaviour in Bumblebees: An Analysis with a Control Group**<br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Introduction to R language</span><br>
Analysed learning behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in a Y-maze using trajectory data from 187 trials. Results showed improved navigation speed and preference for reinforced cues over successive trials, establishing a baseline for stressor studies.<br>

**Coding: Neurodata Analysis of Hippocampal Recordings: Preprocessing and Visualization in Python**
<span class="meta">Internship, supervisor: Dr. Christoph Huber-Huber, CIMeC</span><br>
Developing Python script to extract, preprocess, and visualise hippocampal LFP data from NWB files. Implemented filtering, event annotation, and channel selection to prepare data for time-locked analyses.<br>

**Les Gros Mots en fran√ßais : quand la linguistique de corpus rencontre la sociolinguistique (En: Swearing in French: when corpus linguistics meets sociolinguistics)**<br>
<span class="meta">Bachelor thesis, supervisor: Dr. Hanna Merk</span><br>
Analysed Quebec French swear word usage in the CFPQ, examining frequency, morphology, and euphemistic forms. Found that men swear more frequently overall, but women use swear words as often as men in same-sex conversations; women and older speakers favour euphemisms, and swearing peaks in speakers‚Äô twenties.<br>

**Computational Linguistic Analysis of Authentic and Deceptive Online Reviews**<br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Forensic Linguistics</span><br>
Conducted a computational linguistics study comparing 300 fake and 300 real hotel reviews to identify linguistic markers of deception. Found differences in punctuation frequency, part-of-speech distributions (nouns, verbs), and distinctive n-gram patterns.<br>

**Corpus-Based Sociolinguistic Analysis of the Swearword ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù in Spoken British English**<br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Corpus-based English Language Studies</span><br>
Analysed over 700 occurrences of the word 'fuck' and its variants in the BNC2014 corpus, showing that men use the word nearly twice as often as women, with the highest frequency among students and speakers aged 20‚Äì30. Frequent idiomatic patterns (e.g. 'fucking hell', 'what the fuck', 'fuck off') and auxiliary/emphatic uses were identified as the most common pragmatic functions.<br>

**Grammatical Functions of the Non-auxiliary *Can* in Singapore English Texting**<br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Contact varieties of English</span><br>
Analysed 1,121 tokens of can from a Singaporean SMS corpus to investigate non-standard grammatical functions beyond auxiliary use. Found five distinct non-auxiliary roles (affirmative response, tag question, verb, discourse marker, serial verb), showing systematic substrate influence and identity-marking in Colloquial Singapore English.<br>

**The Combination of Gesture and Speech during Parent-Child Interaction: A Longitudinal Case Study**<br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Semantics</span><br>
Analysed CHILDES video corpus of a monolingual British child (12‚Äì24 months) to examine gesture-speech use in natural parent-child interaction. Found that children gradually shift from imitating parental gestures to using them strategically for communication, with pointing strongly linked to early speech.<br>

**Essay: Could Neanderthals speak?**<br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Language Evolution and Origin</span><br>
