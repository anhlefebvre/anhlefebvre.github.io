# Neuroscience student üß†

Hello,  I'm Anh - a Neuroscience student at Sorbonne University in France. I enjoy working in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, computational modelling and neural data analysis.

Besides my study, I‚Äôm collaborating on a project which aims to disentangle the effect of meaningfulness on working memory. This study grew out of my internship at the Cognitive Psychology Lab at the University of Z√ºrich in Switzerland, and our manuscript is currently in preparation.

I‚Äôll soon be joining a project at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, to investigate how stimulating alpha synchrony with TMS might enhance working memory performance.

## Manuscript
**Internship: Disentangling the Effects of Meaningfulness on Item- and Binding Memory** (In preparation)<br>
Supervisor: Prof. Klaus Oberauer, Dr. Philipp Musfeld, University of Z√ºrich<br>
Investigated how semantic meaning influences visual working memory by replicating prior experiments and applying a Bayesian hierarchical framework. The findings showed that meaningful stimuli enhance both item memory and binding memory, thus supporting the Binding Hypothesis.<br>

<span class="meta">Bachelor thesis, supervisor: Dr. Hanna Merk (2023)</span><br>
Analysed Quebec French swear word usage in the corpus of spoken Quebec French - CFPQ. Examined frequency, morphology, and euphemistic forms. Found that men swear more frequently overall, but women use swear words as often as men in same-sex conversations; women and older speakers favour euphemisms, and swearing peaks in speakers‚Äô twenties.<br>

<span class="project-title"><strong>Corpus-Based Sociolinguistic Analysis of the Swearword ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù in Spoken British English</strong></span><br>
<span class="meta">Seminar: Corpus-based English Language Studies (2023)</span><br>
Analysed over 700 occurrences of the word 'fuck' and its variants in the BNC2014 corpus, showing that men use the word nearly twice as often as women, with the highest frequency among students and speakers aged 20‚Äì30. Frequent idiomatic patterns (e.g. 'fucking hell', 'what the fuck', 'fuck off') and auxiliary/emphatic uses were identified as the most common pragmatic functions.<br>

Analysed 1,121 tokens of can from a Singaporean SMS corpus to investigate non-standard grammatical functions beyond auxiliary use. Found five distinct non-auxiliary roles (affirmative response, tag question, verb, discourse marker, serial verb), showing systematic substrate influence and identity-marking in Colloquial Singapore English.<br>
