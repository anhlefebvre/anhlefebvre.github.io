# Neuroscience student 🧠
I am a second-year Master's student in Cognitive and Behaviour Neurosciences with an interest in memory.  
My motivation is to further develop my knowledge of neural mechanisms of working memory and episodic long-term memory through observing behavioural changes in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Work Experience

**Research Intern** – *Cognitive Psychology, University of Zürich*  
*Mar. 2025 – June 2025* — 3 months, Switzerland  
- Disentangled the effect of meaningfulness on binding and item memory.  
- Responsible for experimental design, programming, and data analysis.

**Research Intern** – *CIMeC, University of Trento*  
*July 2024 – Aug. 2024* — 2 months, Italy  
- Contributed to the #EEGManyLabs replication of Mathewson et al. (2009) on alpha phase and visual perception by conducting EEG sessions.  
- Analysed signal data from epilepsy patients using MNE-Python, focusing on hippocampal EEG and eye movements.

**International Tour Guide** – *Withlocals / EXO Travel*  
*2015 – 2019* — 4½ years, Vietnam  
- Guided German- and English-speaking tourists through southern Vietnam (from Saigon to the Mekong Delta).
- Designed and adapted tours for small, private, and family groups, focusing on authentic cultural experiences such as local markets, traditional workshops, and village life, while avoiding overcrowded tourist areas.
- Enhanced cross-cultural understanding and ensure a personalised experience for each group.

## Projects
**Disentangling the Effects of Meaningfulness on Item- and Binding Memory** (In preparation) <br>
Investigated how semantic meaning influences visual working memory by replicating prior experiments and applying a Bayesian hierarchical framework. The findings showed that meaningful stimuli enhance both item memory and binding memory, thus supporting the Binding Hypothesis.

**Report: Assessment of Two Unknown Compounds in Depression-like and Anxiety Behaviour in Wild-Type SWISS mice** [Read report (PDF)](/assets/files/Report_Neuropharmacology.pdf)  <br>
Tested two novel compounds for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in a murine model using behavioral paradigms (OFT, EPM, TST). Results suggested potential antidepressant properties for one compound, though further research is needed to confirm efficacy.

**Report: Learning Behaviour in Bumblebees: An Analysis with a Control Group** [Read report (PDF)](/assets/files/learning_behaviour_bumblebee.pdf)<br>
Analysed learning behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in a Y-maze using trajectory data from 187 trials. Results showed improved navigation speed and preference for reinforced cues over successive trials, establishing a baseline for stressor studies.

**Coding: Neurodata Analysis of Hippocampal Recordings: Preprocessing and Visualization in Python** [Consult the project (Github)](https://github.com/chsquare/tgazeieeg2/tree/anh) <br>
Developing Python script to extract, preprocess, and visualise hippocampal LFP data from NWB files. Implemented filtering, event annotation, and channel selection to prepare data for time-locked analyses.

**Les Gros Mots en français : quand la linguistique de corpus rencontre la sociolinguistique (En: Swearing in French: when corpus linguistics meets sociolinguistics)** [Read thesis (PDF)](/assets/files/thesis_BA_0309.pdf)<br>
Analysed Quebec French swear word usage in the CFPQ, examining frequency, morphology, and euphemistic forms. Found that men swear more frequently overall, but women use swear words as often as men in same-sex conversations; women and older speakers favor euphemisms, and swearing peaks in speakers’ twenties.

**Computational Linguistic Analysis of Authentic and Deceptive Online Reviews** <br>
Conducted a computational linguistics study comparing 300 fake and 300 real hotel reviews to identify linguistic markers of deception. Found differences in punctuation frequency, part-of-speech distributions (nouns, verbs), and distinctive n-gram patterns.

**Corpus-Based Sociolinguistic Analysis of the Swearword “Fuck” in Spoken British English** [Read report (PDF)](/assets/files/Ling326.pdf)<br>
Analysed over 700 occurrences of the word 'fuck' and its variants in the BNC2014 corpus, showing that men use the word nearly twice as often as women, with the highest frequency among students and speakers aged 20–30. Frequent idiomatic patterns (e.g. 'fucking hell', 'what the fuck', 'fuck off') and auxiliary/emphatic uses were identified as the most common pragmatic functions.

**Grammatical Functions of the Non-auxiliary *Can* inSingapore English Texting** [Read report (PDF)](/assets/files/Ling501.pdf)<br>
Analysed 1,121 tokens of can from a Singaporean SMS corpus to investigate non-standard grammatical functions beyond auxiliary use. Found five distinct non-auxiliary roles (affirmative response, tag question, verb, discourse marker, serial verb), showing systematic substrate influence and identity-marking in Colloquial Singapore English.

**The Combination of Gesture and Speech during Parent-Child Interaction: A Longitudinal Case Study** [Read report (PDF)](/assets/files/Ling301.pdf)<br>
Analysed CHILDES video corpus of a monolingual British child (12–24 months) to examine gesture-speech use in natural parent-child interaction. Found that children gradually shift from imitating parental gestures to using them strategically for communication, with pointing strongly linked to early speech.

**Essay: Could Neanderthals speak?** [Read report (PDF)](/assets/files/Ling229.pdf)<br>
Reviewed fossil anatomy, genetics, and archaeological records to evaluate Neanderthal speech and symbolic communication. Concluded that Neanderthals likely possessed some spoken language and symbolic behavior, though not identical to modern humans.
